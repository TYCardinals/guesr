# Getting Started

To run this application after cloning the repository do a "npm init -y" and then a "npm install". That should handle the frontend on the app and allow the "npm start" command to function as expected.

As for the Backend, change directory to the server folder (cd server) and repeat the process by doing a "npm init -y" and then a "npm install". After hat the server can be hosted on a separate terminal by running "node server"
